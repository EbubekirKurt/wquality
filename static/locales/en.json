  "overview_text": "Our Weather Quality Index (WQI) is an AI-powered system that predicts how pleasant and comfortable the weather will be for outdoor activities. Unlike traditional weather forecasts that only show temperature and conditions, our system evaluates multiple factors to give you a comprehensive quality score from 0 to 100.",
